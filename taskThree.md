Communication between services (just as ServiceA and ServiceB) can be established by either asynchronous(event-driven) approach or synchronous(request-response) approach
Synchronous communication is direct approach of HTTP calls. Example is HTTP request-response cycle. Asynchronous communication is one in which response occurs independently of the request. This basically involves the use of message brokers like rabbitMQ, kafka etc. For using synchronous approach which is basically a request-response cycle approach, the major disadvantage is that it is a blocking model approach and hence, services are still highly coupled together affecting the scalability and performance of the whole system. Although it finds its major use and suitability in a read-heavy application and live data received from outside source. On the other hand, asynchronous communication is non-blocking, loosely coupled and use the event-driven approach. It is more easily testable, developed, deployed and scaled than synchronous approach and most suitable for write-heavy application. But it introduces complexity to our solution.
Synchronous approach of communication is most suitable for solutions that involve receiving live data and basically read-heavy solutions and other use cases like implementing purchase service and login. while asynchronous approach is best suited for solutions that is write-heavy.
